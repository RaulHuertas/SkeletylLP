# SkeletylLP

![Project Image](Images/SwitchMounted.jpg)

A modified version of the skeletyl from Bastard Keyboards to Support KS-33 switches from gateron. I went back in the timeline in Fusion360 and modified the elements that are replicated per button

If you are in Perú, I can build it for you. Contact me at my 3D printing service NutyLABS at Instagram: [NutyLabs](https://www.instagram.com/nutylabs/)
